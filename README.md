- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Vit Dobrinin
- ðŸ‘€ I'm working my way up to the profession of software developer.
- ðŸŒ± At the moment, I am studying Python as the main language, and I also plan to try out development for mobile devices (Flutter,Swift). At the moment, I am only looking for my own path, so the direction of development may still change.
